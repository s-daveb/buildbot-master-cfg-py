A flexible buildobt master.cfg for building C/C++/Obj-C projects.

Supports both autoconf and cmake, and is designed to work with my DockerFiles and BastilleFiles hoste don this github profile.

I've been quietly building this on my ipv6 jail, and wanted to start tracking changes after refactoring it and making it much more flexible.

This was also a fun exercise in Python.
